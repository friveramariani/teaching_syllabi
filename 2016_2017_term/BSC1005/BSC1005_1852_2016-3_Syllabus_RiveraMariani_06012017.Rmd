# II. Textbook
(print or eBook): Reece J., Taylor M., Simon E, and Dickey J. *Campbell Biology: Concepts & Connections*. 7^th^ or 8^th^ edition. Benjamin Cummings. 

# III. Rationale of the Course
To present students the main biological concepts that abound in our continuous inquiry to understand life. With the concepts covered, students will have an introductory understanding of molecular biology, genetics, biochemistry, cellular biology, evolution and other topics that help us understand how biosciences explain the interactions between living organisms and the environment. In addition, real-life and scientific scenarios will be presented to learn the way biology is scientifically practiced, and how biology affects our daily lives.

# VI. Methods of Instructions
A. **Reading assignments** 

1) Will always expose you to a new topic (e.g. terminology, concepts, theories, etc). prior to discussing the topic in class. Therefore, we must complete an online Reading Assignment before we cover a new topic. 
2) Reading assignments count for grade (refer to Graded Items). 
3) Reading Assignments **will be available** on Blackboard Learn (http://mdc.blackboard.com) Thursdays at 1:20PM.
4) Reading Assignments **must be completed** by Tuesdays at 10:00AM. 

B. **Group work** 

1) Facilitate the discussion and peer-teaching of biological terms, concepts, processes, methods, scientific data, among others.
2) In some instances, will provide in-class bonus points opportunities.

C. **Weekly quizzes** 

1) Weekly Quizzes will keep you studying and help you (and the professor) identify the areas that you may be struggling with. 
2) Quizzes are semi-cumulative (integrate 1 or 2 prior topics) to help you connect new knowledge to previous knowledge. 
3) Quizzes count for grade (see to Graded Items), and will only contain 6 to 7 questions in different formats. 
4) Quizzes will be administered the first 20 minutes of each Thursday (except on days where is an exam). Once completed, they will be briefly discussed in class.

D. **Exams**

1) Three 100 points exams will be administrated. 
2) Their corresponding dates are listed on the tentative schedule (syllabus's last page). 
3) No scantrons are needed beaus the professor will provide written feedback on the exams. 
4) Exams are semi-cumulative (exam 2 will contain material from exam1, and exam 3 will contain material from exam 2).

# VII. Academic Integrity

Each student is expected to maintain a high level of integrity and abide by the procedure 4074 of the Miami-Dade College Student Rights and Responsibility Handbook. Any work submitted by a student in the course for academic credit will be the student's own work. For the purpose of this course, collaboration is allowed in the following instances: a) in-class group work, b) case studies discussions, c) or when stated by the professor. Nevertheless, each student must submit their individual work unless indicated otherwise by the professor. D. Avoid at all costs copying and pasting the information from your classmates' response or from any other sources. **The penalty for violation of this Code can include 0 on an assignment, failure of the course and/or notifying the corresponding University authorities for disciplinary action.** Any form of **plagiarism** will constitute Academic Dishonesty, and points won't be earned during any form of this fault. **Make sure you understand what constitute plagiarism and how to avoid it.**
Any other form of Academic Dishonesty listed in the Miami-Dade College Student Rights and Responsibility Handbook will not be accepted during in the course. 

# VIII. Attendance
Attendance at each class sessions parallels with your learning in the course. The course requires the input of time and effort in order to learn and be proficient in the learning objectives stated earlier in the syllabus. In addition, 20 easy attendance points will be awarded to everyone at the beginning. Note that, as stated in the Graded Items section (found in Grading Scales),  10% of the total grade will be your attendance. For each unexcused absence, unfortunately, I'll have to deduct 0.5 point. In the event of an absence, the student will be allowed to make up work if the absence results from one of the following:

A. Official campus activities (as designated by MDC)
B. Family or personal emergencies (as designated by  MDC)
C. Medical reasons (discussed with the instructor)
D. Work-related reasons (discuss with the instructor)
E. Important notes

1) Make-up exams are allowed only if your excuse meets any of the four requirements above.
2) Make-up for quizzes are not permitted.
3) With three unexcused absences, I won't be able to keep you on the class roster. 
4) **With three unexcused absences**, I won't be able to keep your name in the course's roster.

# IX. Late Policy
Unless arrangement have been made prior to the due date or have a valid absence excuse (as stated in the Attendance section of this syllabus), I won't be able to award full grade on Late Assignments (**the final grade for any late assignment will be 30% less**). 

# X. Accomodations for Students with disabilties
In compliance with the Miami-Dade College and the Student Rights and Responsibility Handbook policy and equal access laws, I more than available to discuss any necessary academic accommodations that may be required for the student with disabilities. Requests for academic accommodations are to be made during the first week of the term, except for unusual circumstances, so arrangements can be made. Students are encouraged to contact the Student Services to verify their eligibility for appropriate accommodations.

# XI. Inclusive Statement
Members (student, faculty, administrators) of the Miami-Dade College community represent a diversity of backgrounds and perspectives. In this course, and as a member of this community, I am a strong supporter of diversity and its benefits. Therefore, to maintain an adequate learning and diverse environment students in this course are strongly encouraged to:

A.	share their unique beliefs, experiences, and values
B.	be open to the opinions and views of others 
C.	honor your colleagues' uniqueness
D.	appreciate the unique opportunity we have to learn from each other
E.	value each others opinions and communicate in a respectful manner
F.	keep confidential discussions of personal and professional nature
G.	take advantage of this opportunity to share ways in an inclusive environment

**Every student must maintain, at all times, respectful manners and actitudes.**

# XII. Grading Scales
A. Graded Items
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Item <- c("Quizzes (on Thursdays)", "Attendance", "Reading Assignments", "Reel Polling questions", "1st Exam", "Midterm Exam", "Final Exam")
Percentage <- c("10%", "10%", "5%", "5%", "25%", "25%", "20%")


grading_items <- data.frame(Item, Percentage)
names(grading_items) <- c("Assessment", "Percentage of Total Grade")
library(pander)
pander(grading_items)
```

B. Grading Scale
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
Grade <- c("A", "B", "C", "D", "F")
Percentage <-c("100 - 90%", "89.9 - 80%", "79.9 - 70.0%", "69.9 - 60.0%", "Below 60.0%")

grading_scale <- data.frame (Grade, Percentage)
names(grading_scale) <- c("Letter Grade", "Percentage")

pander(grading_scale)
```


# XIII. Incomplete Grades and Withdrawls
**Incomplete (I)** grades will be posted only in consultation with the student and professor, and only when extenuating circumstances will prevent the student to complete the requirements of the course. At least one-half of the course must have been completed with a C or better grades. It is important that the incomplete (I) be completed within the time-frame agreed between the student and the professor. Unfortunately, if not completed within the agreed time frame, the incomplete must be submitted as an F.

**Withdrawals**: The professor is not entitled to withdraw a student from the course: it is the students' duty to evaluate and monitor how he/she is doing in the course. Knowing your status in the course will be important in the case you determine it is necessary to withdraw from the course. The deadline to withdraw (W) from the course June 27^th^, 2017. Keep in mind that a "W" grade will be permanent in your grade transcripts, and constitute an attempt for the course. 

# XIV. Tentative Course Schedule
**Note**: The tentative course schedule may change at the discretion of the professor
```{r, echo=FALSE, warning=FALSE, message=FALSE}
library(xlsx)
schedule <- read.xlsx(paste0("C:/Users/Felix/Dropbox/Teaching/1_Miami-Dade College/",
                      "2_BSC1005_2016-3/BSC1005_Syllabus_2016-3_schedule_06012017.xlsx"), 1, endRow = 25)

library(pander)
pander(schedule)
